What is Alabaster?
==================

Alabaster is a visually (c)lean, responsive, configurable theme for the `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ documentation system.
It requires Python 3.10 or newer and Sphinx 6.2 or newer.

It began as a third-party theme, and is still maintained separately, but as of
Sphinx 1.3, Alabaster is an install-time dependency of Sphinx and is selected
as the default theme.

Live examples of this theme can be seen on `this project's own website
<https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/>`_, `paramiko.org <https://www.paramiko.org>`_,
`fabfile.org <https://www.fabfile.org>`_ and `pyinvoke.org <https://www.pyinvoke.org>`_.
